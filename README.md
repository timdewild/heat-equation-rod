# Heat Equation for 1-Dimensional Rod
In this animation (made using the [`matnition`](https://github.com/timdewild/matnimation/tree/main) module), we model the cooling of a 1-dimensional metal rod, subject to different boundary conditions (BCs). 

## Solving the Heat Equation
We will solve the heat equation for a 1-dimensional metal rod of unit length. Of course, 1-dimensional rods do not exist, but this is a very good approximation for rods whose thickness $d$ is much smaller then their length $L$. The location along the rod is indicated by the the coordinate $x$, and we work in units such that the rod has unit length. That is, the rod has a spatial extent of $x\in [0,1]$. The temperature along the rod at a given moment in time $t$ is denoted by $u(x,t)$. 

The question we wish to answer is the following: given the temperature distribution along the rod at $t=0$, what will be the temperature distribution at all subsequent times $t>0$?
